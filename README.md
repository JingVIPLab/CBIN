# README

We provide the training framework for the model and the code for the visual and question encoders, and we will release the full code for the remaining core modules when the paper is accepted.

## Encoder

`backbone.py` is our visual encoder.

`question_encoder.py` is our question encoder.

## Train

The training framework is available in `main.py`.
